## 🧪 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Step-by-Step Breakdown

This repository presents a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) workflow, divided into modular notebooks to analyze and preprocess data effectively before building machine learning models. Each notebook focuses on a critical step in the EDA pipeline.

### 📁 Repository Structure

| Notebook | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `Final_EDA.ipynb` | Integrates all EDA steps to provide a complete overview of the dataset. |
| `missing_values.ipynb` | Identifies and handles missing values using various imputation techniques. |
| `Outliers.ipynb` | Detects and treats outliers using statistical methods and visualizations. |
| `cat_numerical_analysis.ipynb` | Analyzes categorical and numerical features with summary stats and plots. |
| `Encoding.ipynb` | Applies label encoding, one-hot encoding, and other transformations to categorical variables. |
| `Feature_binning.ipynb` | Converts continuous variables into categorical bins for better interpretability. |
| `feauture_scallng.ipynb` | Demonstrates normalization and standardization techniques for numerical data. |
